# About TagSweep
Who Made This?
Hey! I'm Melvin Anthony, a professional designer and photographer. Like many, I used Google Photos as a quick and seamless cloud backup. But when my storage started filling up, I decided to migrate everything to a self-hosted platform, Immich.

During this process, I realized that Google Takeout removes essential EXIF metadata, leaving my photos without timestamps or location data. I searched for a solution, but all I found were paid alternatives—and I wasn’t willing to spend money on something I’d use just once.

So, I built TagSweep—a free, open-source app to fix this problem for myself and for others who face the same issue.

# Why Is This Free?
I believe in open-source and self-hosted software, and I wanted to share my work with others who might find it useful. TagSweep is built with a simple UI that runs powerful scripts in the background, making it accessible for everyone.

# Will There Be Updates?
TagSweep is a side project, and I don’t plan on actively maintaining it. If you need improvements, feel free to fork, modify, and enhance the code to suit your needs.

# Want to Support?
If you find TagSweep useful, consider supporting me on Patreon or sharing it with others.
