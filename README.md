# TagSweep

TagSweep
Restore lost EXIF metadata from Google Takeout exports with ease.

TagSweep is a free, open-source macOS app that helps restore missing EXIF metadata (timestamps, geotags, etc.) when migrating photos from Google Photos. Built for those moving to self-hosted solutions like Immich, this tool ensures your memories retain their correct metadata.

Why TagSweep?
Google Takeout exports your photos and videos but strips essential metadata from them. This can cause issues when importing them into alternative photo storage platforms. TagSweep solves this by:

Restoring timestamps: Uses filenames and JSON data to correct missing EXIF dates.

Fixing geotags: Recovers location data where available.

Batch processing: Processes thousands of photos at once.

Simple UI, powerful backend: A clean macOS interface running robust command-line tools under the hood.

How It Works
TagSweep follows a step-by-step process:

Check Prerequisites: Ensures Homebrew, EXIFTool, and jq are installed.

Organize Files: Renames images and JSON files for consistency.

Merge Metadata: Combines JSON data with media files.

Fix Date & Time: Corrects file creation and modification timestamps.

Extras (Work in Progress): Features like batch renaming and cleanup.

Final Step: Displays acknowledgments and support options.
